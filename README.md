# Deep-Q RL Tetris with Extra Pieces
 
## Description:

This project utilizes Reinforcement Learning via Deep Q Learning to train an AI to play a game of Tetris with the traditional seven tetrominoes and three custom pieces I have added.

## Environment:

* **Python 3.6.13** using **Anaconda** 

## Required Libraries:
* **Pillow 8.2.0**
* **opencv-python 4.5.1.48**
* **torch 1.8.1**
* **numpy 1.12.5**
* **matplotlib 3.3.4**
* **tensorboardX 2.2**

## How to use my code:

* **Train** the AI from scratch by running **python train.py**
* **Test** the AI with my training model by running **python test.py**

**NOTE:** If you want to train the AI from scratch the process takes upwards of 5 hours
